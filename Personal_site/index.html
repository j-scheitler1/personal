        <h1>Project 1</h1>
        <p>The first project was related to understanding different sorting meethods. For
          This project I used an assortment of sorting algorithms to find the quickest method. 
          I was given a set of points on a 2D graph and had to find the mean of the set given
          anywhere from 1 to 10,000 points

        <h1>Project 2</h1>
        <p>This project focused on linked lists specifically. I was tasked with creating
          a doubly linked list but each node contained up to six inner nodes. I acomplished
          this by writing a linked list from scratch as well as an iterator in order to 
          traverse the list

        <h1>Project 3</h1>
        <p>The Last project involved me decoding a message using a binary search tree.
          After contructing each tree, each branch left or right gave a value that then
          corresponded with the node. Piecing this all together gave us a decoder for any
          coded message that we were given
